# express-react-ts-auth
Boilerplate for an Express API, React F.E. TypeScript and Auth with Passport

This project has been setup as an Umbrella Repo. The Client and Server directories are independant of each other, including module dependencies.

Local development is done with docker compose. From the root level run `npm start`, after doing module installs in the client and server apps (this is just to allow the local TS watchers to compile)

## Client

React, React-Router, Bulma CSS, Webpack 3

## Server

Express, Postgres (pg), migrations (pgm), Passport.
